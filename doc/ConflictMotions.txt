DESCRIPTION					 *ConflictMotions-description*

This plugin defines movement commands and text objects to go to and operate on
conflicting lines, as indicated by many revision control systems, like
Subversion, Git, etc. The source code management system inserts conflict
markers such as <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> on merges to indicate that the
automatic resolution failed; this plugin helps you with locating and resolving
these conflicts.

RELATED WORKS								     *

To be alerted to the existence of conflict markers and to visually
differentiate the conflicted lines, you can use the highlighting, warnings and
custom buffer status provided by the companion |ConflictDetection.vim| plugin
(vimscript #4129).

USAGE						       *ConflictMotions-usage*
   *]x* *]X* *[x* *[X* *v_]x* *v_]X* *v_[x* *v_[X* *o_]x* *o_]X* *o_[x* *o_[X*
]x			Go to [count] next start of a conflict.
]X			Go to [count] next end of a conflict.
[x			Go to [count] previous start of a conflict.
[X			Go to [count] previous end of a conflict.
					 *]=* *[=* *v_]=* *v_[=* *o_]=* *o_[=*
]=			Go to [count] next conflict marker.
[=			Go to [count] previous conflict marker.

								   *ax* *v_ax*
ax			"a conflict" text object, select [count] conflicts,
			including the conflict markers.
								   *a=* *v_a=*
a=			"a conflict section" text object, select [count]
			sections (i.e. either ours, theirs, or base) including
			the conflict marker above, and in the case of "theirs"
			changes, also the ending conflict marker below.
								   *i=* *v_i=*
i=			"inner conflict section" text object, select current
			section (i.e. either ours, theirs, or base) without
			the surrounding conflict markers.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					*ConflictMotions-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ConflictMotions.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					*ConflictMotions-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the CountJump plugin (vimscript #3130).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				       *ConflictMotions-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

						       *ConflictMotions-remap*
To change the default motion mappings, use: >
    let g:ConflictMotions_ConflictBeginMapping = 'x'
    let g:ConflictMotions_ConflictEndMapping = 'X'
    let g:ConflictMotions_MarkerMapping = '='
To also change the [ / ] prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-motions|. (This requires CountJump 1.60.)

To change the default text object mappings, use: >
    let g:ConflictMotions_ConflictMapping = 'x'
    let g:ConflictMotions_SectionMapping = '='
To also change the i / a prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-text-objects|. (This requires CountJump 1.60.)

1.10	20-Aug-2012
The [z / ]z mappings disable the built-in mappings for moving over the current
open fold. Oops! Change default to [= / ]= / i= / a=. (= as for the characters
in the separator between our and their change).
